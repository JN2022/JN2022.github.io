### Personal
I enjoy reading literature, [hiking](/assets/img/hiking.png), [traveling](/assets/img/traveling.png) and exploring museums and galleries. I'm a Harry Potter fan and a fan of AI sentient novels. I [paint](/assets/img/traveling.png) and write novels in Chinese as a way to relax.

Now I am learning standup comedy and have been preparing my jokes for some time. I prepared a short performance to celebrate my defense. I'm looking forward to presenting it!
