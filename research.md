### Research 

I'm fortuante to have my training supervised by [Peter Ebbes](https://www.hec.edu/en/knowledge/authors/ebbes-peter), [Kristine De Valck](https://www.hec.edu/en/faculty-research/faculty-directory/faculty-member/devalck-kristine) (co-chairs) at HEC. 

In general, my research interests in <ins>online communities participation </ins>, <ins>social media influencer marketing</ins> and <ins>social media advertising</ins>.<br/>
In terms research methodology, I apply <ins>image and text analysis</ins>, <ins>causal inference and causal identification</ins>, <ins>meta analysis</ins>, <ins>cluster analysis</ins>, and <ins>network analysis</ins> in the current research.<br/>

<!--<ins>Abstract:</ins> Decision makers often want to target interventions so as to maximize an outcome that is observed only in the long-term. This typically requires delaying decisions until the outcome is observed or relying on simple short-term proxies for the long-term outcome. Here we build on the statistical surrogacy and policy learning literatures to impute the missing long-term outcomes and then approximate the optimal targeting policy on the imputed outcomes via a doubly-robust approach. We first show that conditions for the validity of average treatment effect estimation with imputed outcomes are also sufficient for valid policy evaluation and optimization; furthermore, these conditions can be somewhat relaxed for policy optimization. We apply our approach in two large-scale proactive churn management experiments at The Boston Globe by targeting optimal discounts to its digital subscribers with the aim of maximizing long-term revenue.  Using the first experiment, we evaluate this approach empirically by comparing the policy learned using imputed outcomes with a policy learned on the ground-truth, long-term outcomes. The performance of these two policies is statistically indistinguishable, and we rule out large losses from relying on surrogates. Our approach also outperforms a policy learned on short-term proxies for the long-term outcome. In a second field experiment, we implement the optimal targeting policy with additional randomized exploration, which allows us to update the optimal policy for future subscribers. Over three years, our approach had a net-positive revenue impact in the range of $4-5 million compared to the status quo.-->

<!--<ins>Abstract:</ins> This paper engineers an intuitive feature that is predictive of the causal effect of influencer video advertising on product sales. We propose the concept of motion-score, or m-score, a summary statistic that captures the extent to which a product is advertised in the most engaging parts of a video. We locate pixel-level product placement with an object detection algorithm and estimate pixel-level engagement as a saliency map by fine-tuning a deep 3D convolutional neural network on video-level engagement data. M-score is then defined as pixel-level engagement-weighted advertising intensity of a video. We construct and evaluate the algorithm with around 40,000 influencer video ads on TikTok, the largest short video platform of the world. We leverage variation in video posting time to identify the causal effect of video ads on product sales. Videos of higher m-score indeed lift more sales. This effect is sizable, robust, and more pronounced among impulsive, hedonic, or inexpensive products. We trace the mechanism to influencers' incentives to promote themselves rather than the product. We discuss how various stakeholders in entertainment commerce can use m-score in a scalable way to optimize content, align incentives, and improve efficiency. -->

With De Valck. K., and Wiertz. C. <br/>

<!--<ins>Abstract:</ins> In social networks, ego behavior is usually a function of the behaviors of her alters'. However, such social contagion or peer effect is hard to identify empirically using observational networks due to endogeneity in tie formation. The latent space models have been proposed under the assumption of assortative mixing as a method of modeling the underlying tie generating process, and it also has been used to adjust for unobserved homophily. At the meantime, Pearl (2009, 2010) suggested that adjusting for one common cause of treatment and outcome might actually increase the net bias by amplifying the bias introduced by an unadjusted confounder. The first part of the paper is on identification: I fit a latent space model to a classic dataset on the diffusion of medical innovation (Coleman et al., 1957,1966) to identify social contagion. The second part is on bias-amplification: I extend Pearl's framework to a nonlinear system and then use simulation to demonstrate that latent space adjustment can sometimes amplify the net bias, thus it should be used with caution.>
