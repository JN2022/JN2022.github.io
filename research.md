### Research 

I'm fortuante to have my training supervised by [Peter Ebbes](https://www.hec.edu/en/faculty-research/faculty-directory/faculty-member/ebbes-peter), [Kristine De Valck](https://www.hec.edu/en/faculty-research/faculty-directory/faculty-member/devalck-kristine) (co-chairs) at HEC. 

I am interested in understanding how social media users interact and what is the impact of their interactions using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies, including meta-analysis, cluster analysis, causal inference, and machine learning algorithms. 
Specifically, I study <ins>what motivates social media users' interactions (the antecedents)</ins>, <ins>what determines patterns of different users' activities (the content)</ins>, <ins>what influences the effectiveness of social media activities (the implementation)</ins>, and<ins>what determines the outcomes of those activities (the consequences)</ins>. 
In my dissertation, I focus on topics related to online community participation and social media influencer campaigns, including: 
1) causes and consequences of social media activities
2) influencers' content creation strategies and their impact on campaign outcomes  
3) factors influencing the effectiveness of influencer campaigns

<ins>**Beyond follower size--investigating influencers' endorsing content creation strategies and the impact on influencer campaign performance.**

With De Valck. K., and Ebbes. P. <br/> 
<ins>Abstract:</ins>  Social media influencers play essential roles in brands' communication with target consumers. Optimizing social media campaigns with influencers has remained a hot topic recently. While most research has focused on influencer selection based on their network degrees, expertise, or other characteristics, this paper investigates influencers' content creation strategy(ies) once they have been selected by the company. We propose that influencers utilize more than one strategy to create content for a campaign based on their multiple personas (a peer to the audience, a persuasive-based brand agent, and a marketer of their self-brand). Our empirical approach employs quantified content data of more than 2500 sponsored Instagram posts to conduct a latent cluster analysis. We document distinct content creation strategies influencers used in practice and provide evidence that influencers' strategy choices are not related to their follower sizes and experience levels (i.e. number of past paid posts and tenure as an Instagrammer). These findings shed light on marketing managers' influencer selection and assessment for future campaigns.

<!--<ins>Abstract:</ins> This paper engineers an intuitive feature that is predictive of the causal effect of influencer video advertising on product sales. We propose the concept of motion-score, or m-score, a summary statistic that captures the extent to which a product is advertised in the most engaging parts of a video. We locate pixel-level product placement with an object detection algorithm and estimate pixel-level engagement as a saliency map by fine-tuning a deep 3D convolutional neural network on video-level engagement data. M-score is then defined as pixel-level engagement-weighted advertising intensity of a video. We construct and evaluate the algorithm with around 40,000 influencer video ads on TikTok, the largest short video platform of the world. We leverage variation in video posting time to identify the causal effect of video ads on product sales. Videos of higher m-score indeed lift more sales. This effect is sizable, robust, and more pronounced among impulsive, hedonic, or inexpensive products. We trace the mechanism to influencers' incentives to promote themselves rather than the product. We discuss how various stakeholders in entertainment commerce can use m-score in a scalable way to optimize content, align incentives, and improve efficiency. -->

<ins>Abstract:</ins> Online communities are since long recognized as useful marketing tools. Understanding what motivates community members to interact with each other and what the outcomes of their interactions are helps enhance the efficiency of marketing interventions. Although numerous researchers from multiple disciplines have studied what drives consumers to participate in online communities and with what outcomes, findings from extant studies are sometimes conflicting and insights are fragmented. We summarize twenty years of online community research by means of a meta-analysis of 72 articles to provide generalized insights in drivers and outcomes of online community participation. The findings suggest that members' participation in online communities is motivated by five types of drivers (emotional, functional, and social bonding needs, social norm pressure, and platform-initiated incentives), and their participation benefits a variety of stakeholders (the members themselves, the community, and the related brands). There is a variation in the strength of driving and outcome effects across community types, community ownership, participation types, and research methods. By systematically integrating the two most important factors related to online community participation, this study contributes to the literature on online community participation.
