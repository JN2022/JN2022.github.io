Iâ€™m a quantative Marketing researcher in the University of Liverpool Management School (ULMS).

Through my research , I analyze social media data using various empirical methodologies to provide managerially relevant insights and strategic guidelines that can help firms adapt their influencer marketing practice and influencers develop their careers.

In my dissertation, I focus on topics related to online community participation and social media influencer campaigns, including: 1) causes and consequences of social media activities, 2) influencers' content creation strategies and their impact on campaign outcomes, and 3) factors influencing the effectiveness of influencer campaigns. 

Apart from my dissertation, I am also interested in studying the creation and dissemination content on social media platforms, such as Instagram, YouTube, and other live-streaming services. My research is relevant for practitioners. In particular, my findings may 1) support influencers with content creation and career development based on data, 2) facilitate efficient collaborations between brands and influencers through effective selection and monitoring, and 3) inform platform policies that have an impact on influencers' posting behavior.
